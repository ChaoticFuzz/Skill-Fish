Just writing for a couple of hours.

It is interesting to think about writing, like what constitutes standard written English grammar. How far off do people veer from that? I have plenty of resources at hand; say the internet, the library, and those around me. I want to learn grammar but I do not want to sit around memorizing grammar rules. I am interested to a degree in editing my own work and seeing how I progress. I do not want editing to take up too much of my writing time. I am also interested in some of the tools people are using to help them with their writing. 

It is the perspective of some to write as much as you can before you sit down to edit. Brainstorming, word association, outlines, questions about what one wants to accomplish with a work, and general parts of a story. I want this to be more than a mere brain dump but I do want to see my writing evolve and work with some family, friends, and others in what I am pursuing.

I want to ride the waves of writing with inspiration and desire to write. When I do not have the desire to write I want to work around that and keep writing. I hope with my practice of writing other things will come along from everything to more attention to detail and planning out research projects. I want to see how far I can get with my own thoughts and references to others. With facts and opinions that will change over time I am interested in jotting down what interests me, mostly. With this I look for some continuity among what could seem random. 

A journal of sorts. A collection of work. An editing history. An adding on of ideas and perspectives I look back upon and say oh yeah or that is not exactly what I meant to say; how can I make it more meaningful, clear, less work for the reader. When do I want to stretch out and make it bit more complex for my own enjoyment and just play around with words?

Writing for me can sometimes be cathartic. Sometimes that writing is never edited and is soon deleted. I like writing with my hands when I can, working on legibility issues. Using as much of a piece of paper as I can. It is my hope to get some of my notes up here regarding what I do away from a computer. Kind of interested in mirror writing and boustrophedon. 

Hoping to flesh out material from some ordinary days. Use schema for modeling. Wander through my thoughts and pin down specific instances of things. Not exactly a day to day itinerary but chunks of one. A record of some pastimes and work. Generally I like reading for pleasure and not being told what I need to do. I also like finishing projects many of which unescapably need help from others for myself. Taking something formless or on the edge of understanding is another interest. I want to visit the boundaries of knowledge where I can form ideas.
